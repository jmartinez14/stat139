####Problem 1. 
For each of the following surveys discuss in 2-3 sentences any possible sources of selection
bias, specifically, undercoverage or overcoverage. Finally, specify what type of sampling was used.

(a) Jill wanted to estimate the mean size of families in her community. She obtained a list of all
the people in her community and used a table of random digits to select a simple random sample
of individuals for her study. Jill then determined the family size for each individual selected in her
sample and calculated the overall mean family size.
(b) A congresswoman reported that letters to her office were running 3 to 1 in opposition to the
passage of stricter gun control laws. She concluded that the vast majority of her constituents opposed
stricter gun control laws.

Problem 1
(a) idea: over coverage? She already had all the data so why didnâ€™t she just use a mean? Other factor: not every individual is part of a family. Also, she can't declare the overall mean with just a sample. She just has a sample mean. Sampling: This is a simple random sample. 
(b) The congressional example is an example of undercoverage. There is a large sampling bias because not everyone who has opinions on gun control will write to their congressperson. There is a chance that opponents would be more likely to write letters. Sampling: None, census?

####Problem 2
You are interested in performing an experiment to compare the effectiveness of three
sunscreens. The experiment will be carried out at Cranes Beach in Ipswich Massachusetts. Rather
than obtaining your sample of people on a single day, you obtain three separate groups of people
on each of three days (Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday). On each day at precisely 11:00am, you
gather a random sample of 30 people at the beach, so that a total of 90 people are involved in the
study. Each study participant is randomly assigned to put on either. Coppertone, Banana Boat, or
a placebo (10 of each brand on each day). You measure the amount of skin redness three hours later
using a special instrument from your lab.
(a) Identify the study units, the treatment groups, the strata (sometimes called blocks in an experiment),
and the response variable in this experiment.
(b) What is the advantage to obtaining samples on three different days rather than one large sample
on a single day?
(c) What aspects of the experimental design allow you (potentially) to be able to conclude that using
one suntan lotion causes less redness than another? Do you believe this study has both internal and
external validity?
(d) How would you modify this study in order to reduce the variability in the response variable? Hint:
think how to subtract out a source of variability in the response.


- (a) **study units**: individuals ??
    **treatment groups**: Experiment Group 1 (Coppertone receivers), Experiment Group 2 (Banana Boat recievers), Control group (placebo receivers)
    **strata**: Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
- (b) Obtaining samples on three different days is a form of stratified sampling, which takes into account the possibility that groups of people who come on different days may have different characteristics
- (c) A couple factors that lead to the potential to make causal inferences or inferences about the general population are that: the study units are picked at random as well, the division into treatment groups is random, the random sample is stratified, and the measurement, time of day, and location, are standardized. Because of this first factor, the study has both external and internal validity.
- (d) Have the same 30 people go to the beach three different days. Because from day to day, the people change as well as the level of sun.
